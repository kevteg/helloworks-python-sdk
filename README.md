# helloworks-python-sdk üêç

Easily create and manage HelloWorks workflow instances. üöÄ

## Installation

    pip install helloworks-python-sdk

## Initial setup

Go to your HelloWorks account and get your public key ID and your private key value

Remember to record the private key immediately and store it in a safe place. The private key value cannot be retrieved later, however keys can be generated at any time.

[See their docs](https://docs.helloworks.com/v3.3/reference#getting-started)
```
from helloworks import HwClient
client = HwClient(api_key_id, api_key_value)
```

- **Note**: Tokens will be refreshed and managed internally
- **Note**: Methods will return a dictionary of HW response

## Create a workflow instance
Method to create an instance of a Workflow to send out to a user:

```
workflow_id = 'IDs located in API request info'
# Participants is a dictionary of dictionaries
participants = {'participant_QIxDNu': {'type': 'email',
				       'value': 'kevteg05@gmail.com', 
				       'full_name': 'Kevin Hernandez'}}
# Merge fields is a dictionary of the available merge fields at Api request info
merge_fields = {'applicantName_f2GtnW': 'Kevin', 'jobTitle_WCUZlG': 'Test'}
response = client.create_workflow_instance(workflow_id, participants, merge_fields)
```

[See the full list of available fields](https://docs.helloworks.com/reference#create-workflow-instance)

## Preview a workflow instance
Method to create a preview instance of a Workflow to send out to a user:

```
workflow_id = 'IDs located in API request info'
# Participants is a dictionary of dictionaries
participants = {'participant_QIxDNu': {'type': 'email',
				       'value': 'kevteg05@gmail.com', 
				       'full_name': 'Kevin Hernandez'}}
# Merge fields is a dictionary of the available merge fields at Api request info
merge_fields = {'applicantName_f2GtnW': 'Kevin', 'jobTitle_WCUZlG': 'Test'}
response = client.create_workflow_instance(workflow_id, participants, merge_fields)
```

## Cancel a workflow instance
Cancel a Workflow Instance that is currently active
```
workflow_instance_id = 'ID returned by the creation of the workflow'
response = client.cancel_workflow_instance(workflow_instance_id)
```

## Get a workflow instance
Retrieve information on a single Workflow Instance

```
document_id = 'You can get the documents IDs after the workflow is finished (Using get_workflow_instance method'
workflow_instance_id = 'ID returned by the creation of the workflow'
request = client.get_workflow_instance_document(workflow_instance_id, document_id, get_request=True) 
```
